# Real-vs-Fake-Face-Detection

Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/hamzaboulahia/hardfakevsrealfaces

## Context
The motivation behind the creation of this dataset is to have a challenging Test set for the task of classifying fake and real human faces. Most of the available datasets on Kaggle are "Uniform" and doesn't present a good variance of face features, particularly for the "Fake" class. Moreover, the fake faces collected in this dataset are generated using the StyleGAN2, which present a harder challenge to classify them correctly even for the human eye. The real human faces in this dataset are gathered so that we have a fair representation of different features(Age, Sex, Makeup, Ethnicity, etcâ€¦) that may be encountered in a production setup.

Total number of images: 1288
Number of "Fake" faces: 700
Number of "Real" faces: 589

## Fake images

We can clearly observe these images are not easy to classify using the naked eye
